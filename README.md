## Directories
| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| .config | Contains webpack configs. |
| src | Contains webpack's main entry point `main.js` which auto-loads all `.twig` files inside `src/templates/` and all subdirectories. |
| src/assets | Contains images (used only during development). |
| src/components | Contains reusable components. |
| src/data | Contains `.yml` files. The contents are accessible in all `.twig` files. |
| src/data/shopify | Contains `data.yml` file with Shopify dummy data (used during development to populate liquid templates). |
| src/layouts | Contains layouts. |
| src/templates | Contains mail templates. The `index.twig` template is reserved for navigation. |

## Documentation

It's important to understand in which order webpack transforms the code. First, webpack compiles the `.twig` templates, then `MJML` tags are compiled to `html`. If the `build` task is running `liquid` isn't compiled and is written directly to the `dist/` directory as `.liquid` files. If the `dev` task is running: data from `src/data/shopify/` is passed to the liquid code, it's compiled to regular `html` and served via webpack-dev-server.

*Development flow*: `Twig` â†’ `MJML` â†’ `Shopify data` â†’ `Liquid` â†’ `.html files` â†’ `Webpack-dev-server`

*Production flow*: `Twig` â†’ `MJML` â†’ `.liquid files`

### Additional notes
- Data from `src/data/` is available in all `.twig` templates.
- Data from `src/data/shopify/` is available during `liquid` compilation in development.
- If you want to write `liquid` tags instead of `twig` tags, you have to escape them with `{% verbatim %}{% endverbatim %}` [about verbatim](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/verbatim.html).
- You might get a Parsing error, especially when using the `<` character in `liquid` tags, use `<!-- htmlmin:ignore -->{% if foo < 5 %}<!-- htmlmin:ignore -->` for a fix.
- Some Shopify specific filters might not exist in the liquid compiler. To fix this for development, you can add additional filters to the `filters` section inside `.config/webpack.common.js`.

## Limitations
- If you change data in files inside `src/data/shopify/`, you have to restart webpack.
- It's not possible to set `shop.email_accent_color` to change it later in Shopify.
- `POS Exchange Receipt` template doesn't work.
